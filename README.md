# zoo-management-system
The main problem and motivation is basically lack of information about various animals. This project is based on the various information related to the animal and the workers which are present in the zoo. Such as when we visit any zoo then we are not aware that which animal is placed at which place.  For knowing this information, we look for a graph present in the zoo, but with this information system we can easily search with the zoo by filling the name of the animal, such as Lion, Tiger, etc. then by running this query one can easily find the block in which the animal is present. The system sends an auto generated order to suppliers when the stock of food and medicine reach the deadline.
